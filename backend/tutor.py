"""The teacher's conversation: understands what the student's message is (an answer, a request to explain the
question, a subject question, a lesson or quiz request, small talk) and replies to THAT before moving on.
No Streamlit here. State is a plain dict so the page can keep it in st.session_state.

Rules the code (not the model) enforces:
- the next onboarding question is only asked after a real answer; clarification, subject questions and small talk
  never advance it
- a question the student already answered (or volunteered earlier) is never asked again
- one vague answer gets at most one follow-up per question, then we accept it and move on (no loops)
- subject questions are answered only from the uploaded document's passages
